# NMOS Status

## Current phase

**Phase 0 — complete (2026-09-22).** Phase 0A exit criteria and all Phase 0B acceptance criteria are met.

**Public beta `v0.1.0-beta.9` (2026-09-23), public repository and image.** The owner can delete a
conversation from the panel's Inspector, raw messages included (ADR 0009, D23, invariant 1 amended;
migration 0012). Evidence: `docs/perf/scale.md` (delete timings, sync A/B), real-UI host check in
ADR 0009. `v0.1.0-beta.8` (2026-09-23): facts are extracted per turn
(user message + reply) with turn-counted backfill, and each chat has "extract all history" and
"rebuild memory" in the Inspector (ADR 0008, D7/D17 revised, D22; migration 0011). Evidence:
`docs/perf/turn-extraction.md` (model comparison, real-UI host check), `docs/perf/scale.md` re-check.
`v0.1.0-beta.7` (2026-09-23): main-generation gating no
longer assumes a preset layout (ADR 0001 amendment 2): presets that add instructions after the user's
turn got no memory in beta.6 and earlier. `v0.1.0-beta.6` (2026-09-23): the Inspector opens inside
the NMOS panel (Status | Inspector | Settings tabs): PocketRisu sandboxes plugins without
`allow-popups`, so the beta.5 link could not open a tab (ARCHITECTURE H15). One PocketRisu settings
entry. `v0.1.0-beta.5` (2026-09-23) was a packaging release: multi-arch image (`linux/amd64`,
`linux/arm64`), `:latest` tag on every release, Inspector "—" for never-enabled features, README
screenshots. `v0.1.0-beta.4` (2026-09-23) was the
stabilization release (issues #6–#19) and UI review on top of `v0.1.0-beta.3` (2026-09-22). Phases 1–3 complete. Phase 4 soft
subset complete (knowledge scope `public` / `limited` / `unknown`, D19, `docs/phases/PHASE-4.md`).
Plugin settings panel configures providers, embeddings, tuning and parser rules. Validated with a
real RisuRealm sim bot and a fresh install from release assets. Still outside the beta: hard
character-POV isolation, threads/causal links, verifier, MCP (Phase 5+; not authorized).

**beta.4 contents.** Projection generations and coverage (D20, ADR 0006), normalized text (D21),
knowledge scope (ADR 0007), CORS PUT, large-chat envelope (`docs/perf/scale.md`), release gate, no
search of unverifiable beta.3 vectors (#17), immediate provider disable (#18), strict config types
(#19), one NMOS panel (status/settings tabs, chat-menu entry, Korean/English), Inspector labels.
Known limitations: `CHANGELOG.md` → 0.1.0-beta.4.

## What exists

| Part | Where | State |
|---|---|---|
| Host evidence | `docs/HOST-FACTS.md`, `fixtures/host/a14c911-2026-09-22/` | S1–S14 (S13 N/A), Q1–Q8, 0B runtime findings |
| Architecture | `ARCHITECTURE.md` | H1–H15, D1–D23, O2/O3/O4 resolved |
| Sidecar + worker | `apps/sidecar` (Python 3.12, FastAPI, psycopg 3, httpx) | sync, hybrid recall, state, facts, inspector; `nmos-worker` jobs |
| Schema | `migrations/0001`–`0013` | source layer, state, extraction/jobs, embeddings, config, knowledge, normalized text, projection generations, knowledge scope, conversation labels, turn extraction, conversation delete, append rows |
| Plugin | `adapters/pocketrisu-plugin` → `dist/nmos-pocketrisu.js` | gating (D13), manifest, sync, recall injection, fail-open |
| Deployment | `docker-compose.yml`, `docker/sidecar.Dockerfile`, `.env.example` | postgres 16 + sidecar |
| Tests | `apps/sidecar/tests` (148), `adapters/pocketrisu-plugin/test` (41) | all passing |
| Performance | `docs/perf/phase0.md`, `docs/perf/scale.md` | Phase 0 targets met; released beta: default deadline met up to ≈5k messages, fail open beyond ≈8k. Unreleased append fast path (ADR 0010): sidecar append 715 → 156 ms at 10k; envelope re-decided after A2 and a real-host check |
| Next work | `docs/proposals/` | Track A (stabilization) in progress: A1 done (unreleased); Track B (Phase 5+) is a proposal, not authorized |
| Decisions | `docs/adr/0001`–`0010` | gating, branches, token (optional), recall scoring, hybrid tuning, projection generations, knowledge scope, turn extraction, conversation delete, append fast path |
| Phase specs | `docs/phases/PHASE-0.md`–`PHASE-4.md` | 0–3 met; 4 soft subset met |
| Retro | `docs/phases/PHASE-0-RETRO.md` | |

## Evidence status (Phase 0A)

| Scenario | Status | Fixture/evidence |
|---|---|---|
| S1–S12 | run | `fixtures/host/a14c911-2026-09-22/` (S4b, S8b variants) |
| S13 | not executable on `a14c911` (no group chat); N/A accepted by owner | HOST-FACTS S13 |
| S14 | run (100 / 1,000 messages) | `…/*S14*` |

## Open owner decisions

- O1 — relationship to MIRRA / VEIL.
- O5 — retention of abandoned worldlines, `host_observation` growth, and superseded projection generations (ADR 0006).
- Phase 5+ scope.
